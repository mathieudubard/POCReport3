# Hanmi ACL Quarterly Analysis and Supplemental Exhibits – Report-to-Data Mapping

This document maps the Hanmi3 Q4 2025 ACL Quarterly Analysis and SuppExh report (target PDF) to the ImpairmentStudio datamodel and to the data we can build from instrumentResult, instrumentReporting, instrumentReference, and macroEconomicVariableInput. It is intended for humans to validate mappings and for implementation.

---

## 1. Data source precedence and filters

- Attribute precedence: When an attribute exists in more than one category, use: instrumentReporting > instrumentResult > instrumentReference.
- instrumentResult: Partitioned by scenario. Use scenarioIdentifier = "Summary" only (weighted average). Optionally filter adjustmentIdentifier = "0" where we need base quantitative (e.g. for collective quantitative vs qualitative split).
- Joins: Join instrumentResult and instrumentReporting to instrumentReference on instrumentIdentifier (and analysisIdentifier where applicable). Reference is the source for segment/metadata (portfolio, methodology, ascImpairmentEvaluation).

---

## 2. Analysis metadata (prior / current / last year / quarters)

- Requirement: An optional input metadata file (e.g. JSON) will describe which analysis is prior, current, last year, and optionally more quarters back.
- Current behavior: Today we assume `analysisIds[0]` = current and `analysisIds[1]` = prior. The metadata file would replace this with explicit roles, e.g. `{ "current": "<id>", "prior": "<id>", "priorYear": "<id>", "quarters": ["<q1_id>", "<q2_id>", ...] }`.
- Use: Drive which analysis IDs we use for “Q4 ’24”, “Q3 ’25”, “Q4 ’25”, and YoY comparisons in each report section.

---

## 3. Macroeconomic variable input

- Category: macroEconomicVariableInput
- Location: Under input root (not `output/` or `export/`), partitioned by scenarioIdentifier (subfolders `scenarioidentifier=<value>/`).
- Filter: Use Baseline scenario only. In `sample/scenario.csv`, Baseline is BASE (`scenarioIdentifier = "BASE"`), description "MEDC Baseline Scenario".
- Attributes (datamodel): `analysisIdentifier`, `scenarioIdentifier`, `asOfDate`, `macroeconomicVariableName`, `valueDate`, `macroeconomicVariableValue`, `importSource`, `databuffetMnemonic`, etc.
- Variable names: Resolve display names (e.g. “Unemployment Rate”, “USA Real GDP Growth”) via `sample/macroeconomicVariable.csv` (columns: `macroeconomicVariableName`, `scenarioStudioMnemonics`, `databuffetMnemonic`, etc.).

Report section 1.1.2 / 1.2 macro table (Moody’s Baseline, 4-quarter historical + 4-quarter forecast):

| Report variable / column   | Datamodel source                    | Sample/metadata name (macroeconomicVariable.csv) |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Unemployment Rate          | macroEconomicVariableInput          | USA Unemployment Rate (or USA Unemployment Rate Monthly) |
| USA Real GDP Growth (Annualized) | macroEconomicVariableInput    | USA Real GDP Growth |
| USA BBB Spread (7–10 Year) | macroEconomicVariableInput          | USA BBB Spread |
| US Treasury 3 Year         | macroEconomicVariableInput          | US Treasury 3 Year |
| USA CRE Price Index Growth | macroEconomicVariableInput          | USA Commercial Real Estate Price Index or USA CRE Price Index Growth |
| FHFA All Transactions Home Price Index | macroEconomicVariableInput | USA House Price Index FHFA |
| Retail Sales (YoY % Chg)   | macroEconomicVariableInput          | USA Retail Sales and Food Services Growth (or similar YoY) |

Output: time series by valueDate (and optionally scenario) for each variable, for the Baseline scenario only.

Implementation: The report builder loads macro data from Baseline, then filters to only the variables in the table above (see `REPORT_MACRO_VARIABLE_NAMES` in `model/model.py`) and to valueDate within 4 quarters back and 4 quarters forward of the current analysis’s `reportingDate` from analysisDetails. No other variables or dates are included in the report.

## 4. Report sections and table mappings

### 4.1 Section 1.1.1 – Segmentations and Methodologies (Segments → Methodology)

- Report: Table mapping Segments (e.g. All Commercial and Industrial, All CRE Investor and Construction, Residential Mortgage, SBA, EFAs) to Methodology (e.g. C&I Loss Rate Model, CRE Loss Rate Model, ECCL).
- Source: instrumentReference (and optionally instrumentResult for consistency).
  - Segment: portfolioIdentifier (and, for CRE sub-segments, assetSubClass1 or assetSubClass2 / custom segment attributes). Map portfolio + sub-type to the report “segment” label (e.g. “Commercial Line of Credit”, “Commercial Real Estate (Gas Station)”).
  - Methodology: instrumentReference.lossRateModelName (or pdModelName / ttcPDModelName if that carries the methodology). Precedence: if present in instrumentResult (e.g. a model name field), use that; else instrumentReference.
- Output: List of `{ "segment": "...", "methodology": "..." }`. Can be derived by distinct (portfolioIdentifier, lossRateModelName) from reference (or result) for the current analysis.

---

### 4.2 Section 1.1.1 – Collectively Evaluated by Methodology

- Report: Table: Methodology, Amortized Cost, Quantitative Reserve, Qualitative Reserve, Total Reserve, % of Evaluation Type.
- Logic:
  - Restrict to ascImpairmentEvaluation = “Collectively Evaluated” (from instrumentReference after join).
  - Join instrumentResult (Summary scenario) to instrumentReference on instrumentIdentifier (and analysisIdentifier).
  - Methodology: instrumentReference.lossRateModelName (or result’s model name if available).
  - Amortized Cost: SUM(instrumentResult.amortizedCost).
  - Quantitative Reserve: SUM(instrumentResult.onBalanceSheetReserveUnadjusted). Optionally filter adjustmentIdentifier = "0" for base quantitative row if needed.
  - Qualitative Reserve: SUM(instrumentResult.onBalanceSheetReserveAdjusted − instrumentResult.onBalanceSheetReserveUnadjusted).
  - Total Reserve: SUM(instrumentResult.onBalanceSheetReserveAdjusted).
  - % of Evaluation Type: (row total reserve) / (total collective reserve).
- Output: One row per methodology (and optionally segment) with the above aggregates.

---

### 4.3 Section 1.1.3 – Loss rates by segment (quantitative)

- Report: Two tables:
  - Main: Segment (Commercial Line of Credit, Commercial Term - Unsecured, SBA, SBA-TLTB, Commercial Real Estate, Construction, Residential Mortgage, Equipment Financing Agreements, Total Quantitative). Columns: Balance (Q4 ’24, Q3 ’25, Q4 ’25), Loss rate (same quarters), Incr/Decr Q→Q and Y→Y, Quantitative Reserve (same quarters), Incr/Decr.
  - CRE sub-segments: Gas Station, Industrial, Mixed Use, Hospitality, Multifamily, Office, Others, Retail, Total CRE.
- Sources:
  - Balance (Total Pooled Balance): instrumentResult.amortizedCost (Summary), summed by segment. Segment = instrumentReference.portfolioIdentifier (and assetSubClass1 / assetSubClass2 for CRE sub-segments). Map portfolio + sub-type to report labels (e.g. “Commercial Real Estate (Office)”).
  - Loss rate: (Quantitative Reserve / Amortized Cost) for the period. Quantitative Reserve = instrumentResult.onBalanceSheetReserveUnadjusted (Summary).
  - Quantitative Reserve: SUM(onBalanceSheetReserveUnadjusted) by segment and analysis (quarter).
- Periods: Use metadata to map analysis IDs to Q4 ’24, Q3 ’25, Q4 ’25 (and prior year if needed). Load instrumentResult (Summary) and instrumentReference per analysis, join, then aggregate by segment; compute Q→Q and Y→Y deltas.
- Output: JSON: e.g. `quantitativeLossRatesBySegment`: list of segments with balances, rates, reserves, and changes by quarter.

---

### 4.4 Net charge-offs (quarterly and annual) by segment

- Report: Quarterly net charge-offs (e.g. Q4 2024 … Q4 2025) by segment; annual net charge-offs (2021–2025) by segment.
- Source: instrumentReporting (primary for charge-offs). instrumentReporting.netChargeOffAmount (or grossChargeOffAmount − recoveryAmount if net not present). Segment from instrumentReporting.portfolioIdentifier (or join to instrumentReference on instrumentIdentifier for portfolio).
- Precedence: instrumentReporting for charge-off/recovery; segment from reference if not in reporting.
- Output: 
  - `netChargeOffsQuarterly`: by segment and quarter (analysisId → quarter label via metadata).
  - `netChargeOffsAnnual`: by segment and year (aggregate reporting by year or use reporting date).

---

### 4.5 Section 1.2 – Qualitative component (rates and reserves by segment)

- Report: Same segment structure as 1.1.3 but for qualitative reserves and rates.
- Sources:
  - Qualitative Reserve: SUM(instrumentResult.onBalanceSheetReserveAdjusted − instrumentResult.onBalanceSheetReserveUnadjusted) by segment (and quarter).
  - Qualitative Rate: (Qualitative Reserve / Amortized Cost) by segment.
  - Segment and amortized cost as in 4.3.
- Output: `qualitativeReservesBySegment`: same shape as quantitative table but qualitative amounts and rates.

---

### 4.6 Qualitative factors matrix and adjustment breakdown

- Report: (1) Matrix: Qualitative factors (e.g. Adjustment to Moody’s Model Output, Remaining time to maturity, CRE Concentration, Policy exceptions, Loan review, Management experience, 2025 Geopolitical) × Segments (C&I, CRE, Const, SBA, SBA-TLTB, Resi, EFAs). (2) Table: Qualitative adjustment by factor with Q4 ’24, Q3 ’25, Q4 ’25 and changes.
- Source: instrumentResult has adjustmentCategory, adjustmentReason, adjustmentValue, adjustmentIdentifier. Qualitative breakdown may be in result rows with non-zero adjustment (adjusted − unadjusted). Map adjustmentCategory / adjustmentReason to report factor names. Segment from joined instrumentReference.
- Note: Exact mapping of each report factor to adjustmentCategory/adjustmentReason may require client-specific rules; document in implementation.
- Output: `qualitativeFactorsMatrix`: which factors apply to which segments; `qualitativeAdjustmentByFactor`: amounts by factor and quarter.

---

### 4.7 Section 1.3 – Individual component (DCF, Collateral Dependent, Other)

- Report: Individually evaluated: Amortized Cost, Specific Reserve, % of Evaluation Type; by type (DCF, Collateral Dependent, Other) and by quarter (Q→Q and Y→Y).
- Source: Filter instrumentReference.ascImpairmentEvaluation = “Individually Evaluated”. Join instrumentResult (Summary). Amortized Cost: instrumentResult.amortizedCost. Specific Reserve: instrumentResult.onBalanceSheetReserveAdjusted (or onBalanceSheetReserve). Sub-type (DCF vs Collateral Dependent vs Other) may come from instrumentReference or result (e.g. riskClassification, or a custom field); if not in datamodel, may need to be supplied by metadata or left as “Other”.
- Output: `individualAnalysis`: by evaluation sub-type and quarter, with amortized cost, reserve, and percentages.

---

### 4.8 Section 1.4 – Unfunded commitment liability

- Report: (1) By segment: Unfunded Commitment Liability (Available Credit), Reserve. (2) Five-quarter trend: Beginning Reserve, Required Reserve, Provision, Total Unfunded Commitment, Quarter-to-Quarter Change.
- Sources:
  - Unfunded exposure (Available Credit): instrumentResult.offBalanceSheetEADAmountLifetime (Summary), by segment (join instrumentReference for portfolioIdentifier).
  - Unfunded reserve: instrumentResult.offBalanceSheetReserve (Summary), by segment.
  - Provision (unfunded): May be in instrumentReporting or instrumentResult (e.g. allowanceProvisionDelta split or off-balance-sheet provision). If no separate OBS provision field, document as “derive from reporting or reserve flow”.
- Output: `unfundedBySegment`: segment, availableCredit, reserve; `unfundedTrend`: by quarter, beginningReserve, requiredReserve, provision, totalUnfunded, quarterChange.

---

### 4.9 Section 1.5 – Sensitivity analysis

- Report: Narrative (e.g. S2 vs midpoint, S1 vs midpoint). No direct table from instrument data; optionally pull scenario weights or labels from metadata. Omit from data payload or add a placeholder section if we have scenario metadata.

---

### 4.10 Exhibit 1 – Parameters inventory

- Report: Various parameters (CRE S/D, C&I S/D, Loss estimation method, Model versions, Scenario, Weight, etc.) by quarter.
- Source: Largely metadata and analysisDetails (from `export/analysisidentifier={id}/analysisDetails.json`). Some values (e.g. model names, scenario names) can be inferred from instrumentReference (e.g. lossRateModelName) and from run/analysis settings. Macro scenario = Baseline from macroEconomicVariableInput.
- Output: `parametersInventory`: key-value or table form from analysisDetails + metadata; document which keys we can populate from datamodel vs metadata only.

---

### 4.11 Exhibit 2 – Peer ratios and Hanmi summary metrics

- Report: ACL %, NPL %, 30–89 DPD %, NCO % (Hanmi and peers) by quarter; Hanmi-only summary.
- Source: Typically external (peer data) or metadata. If NPL/NCO/DPD are present in instrumentReporting or another category, they can be aggregated; otherwise mark as “from metadata or external input”.
- Output: `peerRatios` and `hanmiSummaryMetrics` if we have source fields; else document as metadata/external.

---

## 5. JSON output structure (proposed)

High-level payload with one block per major table/section:

```json
